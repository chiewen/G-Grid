# G-Grid

Here is the source code of the experiments in the submitted paper "A GPU Accelerated Update Efficient Index for k NN Queries in Road Networks". 

The code is developed in Visual Studio 2017, and is designed to be running on a platform of Xeron CPU and nVidia Pascal GPU.

To make the code more readable, we are refactoring some part of it and adding comments these days. The full refactored code will be available before February, 2016.
