# G-Grid

Source codes of the experiments in the paper "A GPU Accelerated Update Efficient Index for k NN Queries in Road Networks". 

The code is developed in Visual Studio 2017, and is designed to be running on a platform of Xeron CPU and nVidia Pascal GPU. To make the code more readable, we have refactorred some parts and added comments.
